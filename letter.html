      MY beautiful wife anshu❤️ <br><br>
      Ever since i met you i have been nothing but happy,I have grown more as a person in the 2 years that we have been together
      than MY ENTIRE LIFE.i dedicate all that to you. youve helped me,tolerated me,loved me so much even though sometimes i didnt deserve it
      I dont know i can express the love i have for you but im sure in the coming years of us being together i can show how greatful i am to you
      this is nothimg but very small scale gesture to the mountains of love that you deserve and that im sure ill give you aage jaake.
      I LOVE YOU Anjali always and forever.
